# SuperImageView-for-Android
A powerful Image browser for Android that supports 4 types of gestures: two-finger zooming, double-click zooming, two-finger rotating and dragging.

[Usage]
It's super easy to use in that it can be used the same way as "ImageView" on Android as following:

     <com.c35.nmt.widgets.SuperImageView
          android:layout_width="fill_parent"
          android:layout_height="fill_parent"
          android:src="@drawable/sample" />

Also you need to change the package name according to your own project.
